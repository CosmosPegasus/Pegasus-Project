    <h5>What is a IP address?</h5>
    <div class="pra">
    <p>In 1969, The Advanced Research Projects of the U.S Department of Defense started to fund a research network called “ARPANET”. In their first day at their office, “ARPANET” operated on 4 different hosts, which each had a unique address for online communication. With the U.S department of defense,they developed a transmission control program where it was developed into 4 versions and in the 3 versions of the program, the transmission control program (TCP) and Internet protocol or (IP) combined to form the First IP address program called “IPv4”. Currently, IPv4 is a complete program that can generate 4.3 billion IP addresses by using 32-bit numbers that are divided into 4 bytes that are separated by dots. In Cybersecurity, IP addresses can be used as important data in order to assess the amount of risks your system has and allows you to find and respond to any attacks from hackers.  The IP address is created so the computers can talk to each other. The IP address allows information to be sent to the DNS, Web, and Mailing Server. The servers enable the DNS server to get the answer sent to the client. The IP address can be the doorway into accessing valuable information. The IP address in cybersecurity is essential to recover , encrypt, or delete information from the software of the computer. </p>

    <h5>What is a port</h5>
    <div class="pra">
    <p>Early in the 1980’s and currently today, Internet protocols are protocols with established sets of rules that can determine how data was transmitted between different devices on the same network. The world wouldn’t work the way it does now without the “transmission control protocol” and the Internet protocol” working together. In 1984, a protocol named “Domain Name systems” or (DNS) was introduced and took the world by storm. The Domain Name systems or (DNS) was at the time, a decentralized naming system that could be used to identify different computers that were reachable through the internet or the Names of different websites or hosts. When a user for example enters the name of a website that they want to search or host, the DNS is able to map certain numbers to names of the different websites and lets the internet know which numbers to send to query in the DNS database.  Other well known protocols that are used today because of “DNS” are (DHCP) “assigns IP addresses to network endpoints so they can communicate with other network endpoints over IP”,(SMTP) “controls how different clients send user emails messages”, (TCP) “Arranges different packets in order so the IP can deliver them”,  “Hypertext Transfer protocol” (HTTP) (allows users will access to different Web Browsers and can share different files with TCP/IP and “Border gateway protocol” (BGP) (controls multiple packets thought different routers in order to make the internet work)</p>

    <h5>What is a password?</h5>
    <div class="pra">
    <p>The length and complexity of a password can increase the security of your private and personal belongings. Passwords can help establish the second layer of defense from hackers. Good passwords force hackers to take far longer than normal to hack your computer. In the words of Trend Micro News for having a short weak password is “ A weak password offers you little protection. You may as well be laying out a welcome mat for identity thieves.” Mirco News is giving this message to grant you the knowledge of how not to fall prey to hackers by creating one password for all sites that require passwords or having short passwords. Data Encryption converts text into code that only those who have the keys to see it can see but the public cannot. Authorized users are the only ones who are allowed to see sensitive data from you. Encryption prevents banking information from being stolen or passwords for buying movies. AES known as Advanced Encryption Standard is used by governments and businesses for classified information. AES is already implemented into most technology inorder to protect your device. RSA is called Riverst Shamir Aldeman this is another standard encryption used for data being sent online and relies on public key. RSA can be used to verify digital signatures or decipher if the person signing in matches the username and password. </p>

    <h5>What are hashes?</h5>
    <div class="pra">
    <p>In computing, Hashes are mathematical functions that can convert an input of arbitrary number lengths into an encrypted output of a fixed length. This allows the original amount of data or file size to be the same size. Also each time you run data through the mathematical formula, you will get the same exact hash out of it. A method called “Hashing” works only in a one-way direction that will allow you to get the same hash but, you can’t turn the hash back into its original data. Also, Hash functions are commonly used data structures for checking the integrity of messages being sent, and authenticating different information being sent. Hashing has a certain method you can do to protect your passwords from falling into the hands of hackers. If the system you use stores your passwords as a Hash, A hacker will still be able to see your password but will not be able to change or edit your current password. </p>
